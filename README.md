## Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structured with semantic, accessible markup across sections.
* **CSS3:** Custom properties (CSS variables) for full dark/light theming, responsive layouts, and refined UI styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles theme toggling, interactions, and DOM-based behaviors.
* **GSAP (GreenSock):** Core animation engine for entrance, hover, and scroll-linked motion.
* **ScrollTrigger:** Controls scroll-based animations for pricing cards and feature sections.
* **Lenis:** Provides smooth, hardware-accelerated scrolling for a premium feel.

## Features

* **Dynamic Mouse Follower:** Custom cursor that tracks the pointer and scales on interactive elements, using `mix-blend-mode` for a crisp inversion effect on dark backgrounds.
* **Dark / Light Theme Toggle:** A custom moon/sun toggle in the navbar that switches between dark and light themes by swapping CSS variable sets on the `<body>`.
* **Scroll-Triggered Animations:**
  * Pricing cards slide and fade into view as the user scrolls into the pricing section.
  * Feature blocks and content cards animate with staggered motion to guide user attention down the page.
* **Advanced Hover Effects:**
  * GSAP-based scaling on pricing cards that works seamlessly with scroll animations.
  * Smooth scale and highlight states on buttons and social icons for a more tactile interaction.
* **High-Fidelity UI:** Carefully tuned typography, spacing, gradients, and glow effects to match a professional Web3 product landing page feel.
